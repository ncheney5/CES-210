JRR Tolkin worte a series of languages that he latter used in his books. The prosses he used to do this was a linguistic 
principle called sound change evolution. Sound change evolution is the prosses where due to circomstances and other phanomina
a word in a language changes a sound to be a diffrent sound over time. Tolkien artificaly did this by taking 2 languages and 
forcing the evolution rules on it until a uniform set of rules is determined and a new language is created. As the hobby of
creating languages is growing, this program aims to provide a way to do this form of language making in a way simple for the user.
This program uses english as the base language and provide 20 preset change rules mimicing historical sound change rules.
The user is also allowed to make their own rules as well as adding and removing words from the language base. A translator is 
provided for ease of looking up what words would be.

Run the program and follow the promts on the screen. One must compile the dictionary first before using the search and translator 
funtions, otherwise it will translate to empty responses. 

as a recomendation, start by creating a rule or selecting from the preset ones and then go from there.
